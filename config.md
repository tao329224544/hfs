#### Virtual File System (VFS)

The virtual file system is a tree of files and folders, collectively called *nodes*.
By default, a node is a folder, unless you provide for it a source that's a file.
Valid keys in a node are:
- `name`: this is the name we'll use to display this file/folder. If not provided, HFS will infer it from the source. At least `name` or `source` must be provided.
- `source`: absolute or relative path of where to get the content
- `children`: just for folders, specify its virtual children.
  Value is a list and its entries are nodes.
- `rename`: similar to name, but it's  from the parent node point.
  Use this to change the name of  entries that are read from the source, not listed in the VFS.
  Value is a dictionary, where the key is the original name.
- `mime`: specify what mime to use for this resource. Use "auto" for automatic detection.
- `default`: to be used with a folder where you want to serve a default html. E.g.: "index.html". Using this will make `mime` default to "auto".
- `can_read`: specify who can download this entry. Value is a `WhoCan` descriptor, which is one of these values
    - `true`: anyone can, even people who didn't log in. This is normally the default value.
    - `false`: no one can.
    - `"*"`: any account can, i.e. anyone who logged in.
    - `[ frank, peter ]`: the list of accounts who can.
- `can_see`: specify who can see this element. Even if a user can download you can still make the file not appear in the list.
  Value is a `WhoCan` descriptor, refer above.
- `can_upload`: specify who can upload. Applies to folders with a source. Default is none.
- `can_delete`: specify who can delete. Applies to folders with a source. Default is none.
- `propagate`: by default, permissions propagate. Use this to stop propagation of some permissions assigned to this node. 
  For each permission you don't want to propagate you specify the name and set it to false. E.g.
  ```
  can_see: false
  ```
  Default is "all propagates".
- `masks`: maps a file mask to a set of properties as the one documented in this section. E.g.
  ```
  myfile.txt:
    can_see: false
    can_read: false
  "**/*.mp3":
    can_read: false
  "*.jpg|*.png": 
    mime: auto
  ```
  Rules on top have priority over bottom rules. Inner rules have priority over parent's rules.
  A mask can carry any node property (even property "masks") plus a special property `maskOnly` (optional) to restrict
  the application of the mask to only files or folders, just by specifying exactly `files` or `folders`

Permissions set on an inner element will override inherited permissions. This means that you can restrict access to folder1,
and yet decide to give free access to folder1/subfolder2.

#### Accounts

All accounts go under `accounts:` property, as a dictionary where the key is the username.
E.g.
```
accounts:
    admin:
        password: hello123
        belongs: group1
    guest:
        password: guest
    group1:
```

As soon as the config is read HFS will encrypt passwords (if necessary) in a non-reversible way. It means that `password` property is replaced with an encrypted property: `srp`.

As you can see in the example, `group1` has no password. This implies that you cannot log in as `group1`, but still `group1` exists and its purpose is to
gather multiple accounts and refer to them collectively as `group1`, so you can quickly share powers among several accounts.

For each account entries, this is the list of properties you can have:

- `ignore_limits` to ignore speed limits. Default is `false`.
- `redirect` provide a URL if you want the user to be redirected upon login. Default is none.
- `admin` set `true` if you want to let this account log in to the Admin-panel. Default is `false`.
- `belongs` an array of usernames of other accounts from which to inherit their permissions. Default is none.
